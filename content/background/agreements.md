## WAYS TO ENTER THE SPACE TO WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH ONE ANOTHER

- **RESPECT:** Though we may have different backgrounds or points of view, I enter this space respecting every person through my language, gestures, and actions.

- **OPENNESS:** I set the intention to enter this space with an open mind and heart so that I can give and receive information, knowledge, and wisdom through shared experience.

- **ACTIVE LISTENING:** I am present in this moment to hear my neighbor's words, to reflect on what is being said, to bear witness to the stories, and to give supportive, thoughtful feedback.

- **RECIPROCAL:** This is a mutually beneficial space where our actions of giving and receiving lead to the well-being of children/students who are at the center of our intentions.

- **STRIVING:** In this co-created space, I strive to expand and stretch my imagination to be as inclusive and equitable in my thinking for the purpose of contributing my valuable insights to this important endeavor.
