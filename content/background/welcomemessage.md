Dear community members, parents, family members, caregivers, educators, and teachers,

As the Project Director and Primary Investigator, and the Associate Director of the Digital Education Hub of the Indiana University School of Education-Indianapolis at IUPUI, we are excited to welcome you to the first Community Caucus!

We share your concerns about supporting quality, equitable, and inclusive education for all of children in Indiana, concerns that have grown deeper as we work our way through the COVID19 pandemic, as the inequalities that were already there have been made worse. We look forward to working with you and learning with you on these issues, looking to make a difference for all children and learners in the state, especially yours.

We are especially excited to welcome our keynote speaker, Andratesha Fritzgerald, author of Antiracism and Universal Design for Learning. She will be engaging with us in this problem-solving journey, sharing her wisdom and experiences to help us to figure out ways to meet the goals of equitable and inclusive education with technology a reality. This caucus is being planned and organized by a dedicated and highly talented group of faculty, staff, and students, all dedicated to not only hearing you, but amplifying your voices and promoting your agency so that all learners—irrespective of race, socioeconomics, ethnicity, home language, religion, or ability—can participate with honor in who they are and where they come from and contribute in meaningful ways to their learning, their classrooms, and their broader communities.
