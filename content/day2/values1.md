Revisit the Jamboard from yesterday on home and school values in the "Getting to Know Each Other" activity.

### **INSTRUCTIONS:** 

Working with your groups, please do the following:
-Expand upon and discuss your home values and what you believe to be school values or expectations. A DEH team member will write these down in a shared document.


-Next, using a Venn Diagram, decide, as a group, what are strictly "home" values and "school" values.

-Then decide what are values of both that intersect. The DEH team member will capture the connections as well as the differences.
