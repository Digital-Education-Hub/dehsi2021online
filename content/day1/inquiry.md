## Empowering Families & Communities

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

In groups, you will be given specific materials or resources generated by/for the Digital Education Hub (DEH). These materials may include lesson plans, tutorials, modules, website resources/tools, or other products/processes related to the DEH.

Using an evaluative tool, you will assess how equitable and inclusive the DEH materials are for students, families, and/or communities in relation to our discussion centered on equity and inclusion.
