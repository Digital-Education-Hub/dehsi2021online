Before beginning, the DEH will model what the activity in the breakout sessions will look like. Break out groups will consist of 3 -4 people.

## Instructions:

1. In your small groups, you will get to know one another using specific prompts. This is a "speed interviewing" format, so answers need to be brief.

2. Introduce yourselves.

3. Choose 1 person as a timekeeper to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to speak since each person will only have about 2 minutes to answer each prompt for this activity. A DEH facilitator will be the Scribe taking notes on a Group Jamboard.

4. Using **Handout 1: Getting to Know Each Other** as a guide (found on next page), each group member will choose 1 prompt from the column, "Your Current or Childhood Home & Values."

5. Then, each person has 2 minutes to talk about your home experience and values.

6. After the first rotation, each group member will choose 1 prompt from the column, "School Values" and, like before, will have 2 minutes speak about this topic.

7. After the second rotation, we will meet as a large group. One representative from each group will briefly summarize 1 or 2 points about what was discussed in the group.

8. Brief summary of discussion facilitated by DEH member.
