## Instructions

- During this activity, we will be keeping in mind our home values and what we perceive to be school values. What are some similarities? What are the differences? What tensions arise between the two environments?
- We will consider what we believe to be inclusive and equitable practices as we review a brief summary of these practices as shared by community stakeholders in a previous meeting.
- With these points in mind, we will evaluate DEH materials/resources thinking specifically about equity and inclusion through the lens of "empowering families and communities."
