We acknowledge and honor the ground beneath our feet and recognize the cultural and historical legacies it holds for us if we dare to (re)member. What messages can we learn from the land, air, water and space around us and our communities?

## Prayer Bowl

When the moon is turned upwards like a bowl waiting to be filled
We must fill it. We must fill it by honoring the spirits of creation With songs of our joy and thanks, with foods created with our own hands, Water for the thirsty, prayers for the people, prayers for the spirits, Prayers for the Creator, prayers for ourselves, and the sacred instruments That join us to the glory of this world, that join us to the glory of this world And to the world beyond our sleep.

*Karenne Wood(1960-2019), Monacan, was a poet and linguistic anthropologist.*
